				<h1>Parking</h1>
				
				<p>UCLA PARKING aims to make parking at UCLA as convenient as possible for all our campus visitors, with over 50 surface lots and multi-level parking structures located throughout the campus. Vehicles parked in a non-metered UCLA lot or structure must display the valid permit. These permits indicate where and when the permit holder is authorized to park. Finding the right location to park will largely depend on space availability and authorization to park in specific parking area. Please refer to the campus-parking map to find the closest open Information &amp; Parking Booth.</p>
				
				<h3>Parking Pay Stations</h3>
				
				<p>Pay stations allow you to select the time you need to spend on campus and pay accordingly (all-day passes can also be purchased). Parking Pay Stations accept $1 and $5 dollar bills, as well as VISA and Master Card credit cards.</p>
				
				<h3>Daily Permits</h3>
				
				<p>Visitors may purchase daily parking permits ($11 per vehicle) by stopping by any of the 11 Information &amp; Parking booths conveniently located throughout campus.</p>

				<h1> FAQs </h1>
				
				<em>If I am the lucky owner of a deluxe pass to the JazzReggae Festival, what do I do the day of the show?</em>
				</br>
				Deluxe ticketholders will enter the festival through Wilson Plaza with the regular ticket holders. Deluxe ticket participants must check in at the deluxe check-in table, which will be placed near the entrance of the exclusive deluxe area. You will not be permitted to enter the special reserved area until you check in so be sure to hold on to your tickets! We would hate to have you miss out on the amazing extras waiting for you!  
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>What time do the gates open and what time does the festival end?</em>
				</br>
				Gates will open at 11 AM each morning, and performances end exactly at 7PM. Unfortunately, vendors will cease making sales at 7PM as well.
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>What is the seating arrangement going to be like?</em>
				</br>
				Because there are no chairs allowed at this year's JazzReggae Festival, we're proud to promote picnic style seating, making the JazzReggae Festival the largest picnic style event in the LA area! Festival-goers with VIP seating will be accommodated within our separate deluxe area! Attendees with disabilities will be accomodated on a case by case basis! If you have any questions, please feel free to call us. 
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>Are ins and outs acceptable?</em>
				</br>
				No, but the festival will provide all necessities for the perfect weekend rocking out in the sun. Why would you want to leave?
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>Will there be ATMs on site this year?</em>
				</br>
				Absolutely. All of our vendors this year accept cash only. If you forget to bring cash with you, we will have ATMs on-site for your convenience. 
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>What kind of grub are we talking about?</em>
				</br>
				JazzReggae is proud to represent the diverse culture of LA that it celebrates! We're excited to host an array of international food vendors including, but not limited to: Jamaican (jerk chicken), Caribbean cuisine, Chinese, Creole, American, and much more! If you have a specific vendor you'd like to see at the festival, please email us at vendors@jazzreggaefest.com! We'd love to hear your suggestions!
				</br>
				</br>

				<em>What will the weather be like the weekend of the festival?</em>
				</br>
				We're anticipating bright, sunny weather this Memorial Day Weekend, and we're looking forward to seeing you come out and enjoy the lovely Los Angeles weather with us! In the unlikely event that we do experience rain, be sure to pack a jacket so you won't miss out on any of the special plans we have in store! 
				</br>
				</br>

				<em>I want to bring my kids to the festival this year! Is it true children are admitted for free?</em>
				</br>
				Yes! We are happy to admit all children under the age of 8 as long as they are accompanied by a paid adult. After all, every one should be able to join in the celebration.
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>What should I bring with me to the festival?</em>
				</br>
				JazzReggae guarantees an unforgettable weekend of music and memories, so pack accordingly! Some ideas include sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat, a light sweater, blankets, shoes, cash, good friends, and beautiful smiles. 
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>What shouldn't I bring to the festival?</em>
				</br>
				We do not allow chairs, coolers, glass bottles, alcohol, tents, pets, umbrellas, knives or weapons of any sort, high heels, boots, or canopies within the festival grounds. In doing so, it may delay your entrance to the festival- and you definitely don't want to do that!
				</br>
				</br>
				
				<em>How is the bathroom situation? Any toilets?</em>
				</br>
				Porta-Potties will be available at the festival, along with ADA certified Porta-Potties. Convenient, eh?
