				<h1> Arts Exhibit </h1>
JazzReggae is pleased to announce the various art exhibits and craft projects featured at this yearâ€™s festival! The art exhibition is expected to be better than ever this year with dynamic art pieces and installations provided by both hip companies and local artists.
<br>
<br>
The art exhibit will continue the thread of sustainability that is largely apparent throughout the entire festival with the use of eco-friendly paints and recycled canvases. With the expertise of the JRF Sustainability crew, we will also feature a colorful and vibrant installation made from recycled materials. As we believe that green living can be beautiful, there will also be an eco- friendly craft station featuring kid-focused projects and activities. Further, there will be a large- scale chalkboard on which visitors can voice their green initiative in an artistic and creative way.
